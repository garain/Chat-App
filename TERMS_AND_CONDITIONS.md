This Agreement sets forth the general terms and conditions of your use of the ChatApp application and any of its products or services (collectively, "Application" or "Services").

## Accounts

You must be at least 13 years of age to use this Application. By using this Application and by agreeing to this Agreement you warrant and represent that you are at least 13 years of age. If you create an account on the Application, you are responsible for maintaining the security of your account and you are fully responsible for all activities that occur under the account and any other actions taken in connection with it.

We will not be liable for any acts or omissions by you, including any damages of any kind incurred as a result of such acts or omissions. We may suspend, disable, or delete your account (or any part thereof) if we determine that you have violated any provision of this Agreement or that your conduct or content would tend to damage our reputation and goodwill. If we delete your account for the foregoing reasons, you may not re-register for the our Services.

## User content

We do not own any data, information or material ("Content") that you submit on the Application in the course of using the Service.

Unless specifically permitted by you, your use of the Application does not grant us the license to use, reproduce, adapt, modify, publish or distribute the Content created by you or stored in your user account for commercial, marketing or any similar purpose. But you grant us permission to access, copy, distribute, store, transmit, reformat, display and perform the Content of your user account solely as required for the purpose of providing the Services to you. Without limiting any of those representations or warranties, we have the right, though not the obligation, to, in our own sole discretion, refuse or remove any Content that, in our reasonable opinion, violates any of our policies or is in any way harmful or objectionable.
